Week 10 



Script 4:

Pakistan’s 70-year-old supermarket began as a small kiryana in Karachi. 

This is Imtiaz, the country’s largest retail chain— 
founded in 1955 by Hakim Khan Abbasi, 
and later carried on by his son Imtiaz Hussain, 
earning him the Sitara-e-Imtiaz for his contribution to Pakistan’s retail and economy. 

In the early years, 
he introduced home delivery by bicycle and handwritten flyers— 
small innovations that built customer loyalty. 

After a 1978 trip to Singapore,
he returned inspired by the Al-Mustafa Store model,
expanding from groceries to a full shopping experience.

Today, Imtiaz operates 32 stores in 14 cities, 
employs over 14,000 people, 
and serves more than a million loyal customers every day. 
A report estimates its revenue between Rs 60–70 billion in 2024. 

Built on affordability, trust, and scale— 
Imtiaz didn’t just grow. It redefined how Pakistan shops.


Script 3:

Arshad Chaiwala’s CNIC was suspended by NADRA over citizenship issues.
In 2016, a photograph of Arshad pouring tea at a stall in Islamabad went viral,
turning the young seller from Mardan into an overnight global sensation.
Born and raised in Shah Allah Ditta,
he supported a family of 17 siblings before the internet found him.
By 2020, he launched Café Chaiwala in Islamabad.
In 2024, he secured a Rs 10 million deal on Shark Tank Pakistan
to scale his tea-brand and expand into packaged blends.
By 2025, he opened a £250,000 flagship outlet in South London.
The brand now offers UK franchises with projected annual sales of £1.15 million
and 19 percent profit margins.
In October 2025, the Lahore High Court confirmed he is Pakistani —
closing a case that questioned the identity of one of Pakistan’s most viral faces.
From a Sunday bazaar stall to a global tea chain —
Arshad is proof that a viral photo can change more than a life.
It can change a family’s fate —
when vision turns fifteen seconds of fame into generational wealth.


Script 2:
Irfan Junejo is heading to Spain to interview FC Barcelona players.
Becoming the first Pakistani creator to collaborate with one of the biggest football clubs in the world.
From Karachi to Camp Nou —
Irfan’s story started in a small room with a borrowed camera and a simple idea:
to make ordinary life look cinematic.
He spoke softly, edited sharply, and made stillness feel powerful.
His vlogs didn’t chase fame — they changed how Pakistan saw creators.
In 2020, his short film “How I Quit Vlogging” crossed a million views,
opening an honest conversation about burnout and creative pressure.
He later hosted Spotify Pakistan’s “Unfiltered”,
interviewing artists like Young Stunners and Talal Qureshi,
and in 2021, filmed a travel short with Emirates in Dubai.

Pioneering Pakistan’s cinematic vlog movement,
He's inspired a generation of storytellers who followed his lens.
Today, with over 1.4 million subscribers and hundreds of millions of views,
he’s built a career on honesty and craft,
effectively creating the “Junejo aesthetic.”
And now, that voice is going global —
without ever losing where it came from.

Script 1:

Arsalan “Ash” Siddique won Tekken in Las Vegas.
At EVO, the world’s premier fighting-game tournament.
He clinched his 6th title, facing off in an all-Pakistani final.



He picked Nina Williams.
While his opponent chose Anna Williams.
Two sisters in the game—two rivals on stage.
Arslan came out on top.

Before Las Vegas, His breakthrough came in 2019 —
when he became the first player ever to win EVO Japan and EVO USA in the same year,
earning over $27,000 across both tournaments.
That win didn’t just introduce him to the world —
It introduced Pakistan to global esports.

He grew up in Lahore, playing Tekken in small gaming cafés 
Training through power cuts, outdated consoles, and borrowed controllers, 
For years, Pakistan’s esports scene had no official tournaments, funding, or global exposure but he persisted and changed the game. 

Since then, he’s built a career few can match:
a 7-time EVO champion, Red Bull-signed athlete,
and member of the Pakistani Tekken 7 Nations Cup team
that took home US $500,000 in Riyadh 2023, defeating South Korea.
and proving that world-class talent can come from anywhere.

Week 9 (Oct 13 -19)





Script 4:

She’s pulling clean water straight from the air.
Meet Nida Yousaf Sheikh,
a Pakistani social innovator with an master in Economic Psychology,
from the London School of Economics,

Her work began with the H2O Wheel— 
a 40-litre rolling container that shifts the weight from shoulders to ground,
so women didn’t have to carry water for miles.

And resulted in her founding H2O Technologies,
a company developing off-grid systems
that extract safe drinking water from humidity —
powered by solar energy or manual rotation,
bringing water to the places pipelines never reached.
Her technology has already delivered over 500 million litres
to underserved communities across Pakistan,
with a goal to make 25 million people water-secure by 2030.
It’s an innovation born from scarcity —
and built for resilience.
This year, Nida was named a South Asian finalist
for the Unlock Her Future Prize 2025,
selected from over 3,000 women entrepreneurs across the region.
The global program by The Bicester Collection
offers up to US$100,000, mentorship,
and access to Oxford Saïd Business School
to scale women-led social innovation.
From sunlight to air —
She's turning survival into science.


Script 3:

He’s a weaver turned entrepreneur —
who turned a single Karachi boutique to a Khaadi.
Meet Shamoon Sultan,
He trained at the Indus Valley School of Art and Architecture,
studying handloom and textile craft,
then spent years working under Noorjehan Bilgrami and in mills across Pakistan,
before launching Khaadi in 1998.
But his real pivot came with Weaves Corporation —
the reimagined parent company that turned one label into a living ecosystem.

Today, Weaves spans fashion, food, social enterprise, and retail experience,
housing brands like Chapter 2, Kanteen, and Kreate Your Mark —
creating over 1,400 jobs worldwide,
and blending design with inclusion, commerce with conscience.
The IFC’s $25 million investment in Weaves backed not just its scale —
but its story: Pakistan’s first truly global creative corporation.
The IFC’s $25 million investment in Weaves backed not just its scale —
but its story: Pakistan’s first truly global creative corporation.
He’s not just preserving a craft —
he’s building a brand designed to outlive its maker.
Script 2:
She built an AI that speaks justice— 
from the margins to the bench.
Meet Khushbakht Shah Jillani,
a Pakistani lawyer and founder of  Mehfooz AI,
a legal-tech tool that helps judges and lawyers 
handle domestic-violence cases 
with trauma-informed care and data-driven insight.
A graduate of the University of London,
she spent her early career fighting for women’s rights and family-law reform,
until she realized the problem wasn’t only in the laws —
it was in how they were applied.
That’s what Mehfooz AI tries to change.
It analyzes evidence, flags bias, and helps legal professionals
build fairer, more compassionate decisions in sensitive cases —
now piloting across district courts in Pakistan.
Her work led her to the Unlock Her Future Prize 2025,
a global competition where she’s one of the South Asian finalists 
chosen from over 3,000 applicants.
The program offers up to US$100,000, mentorship,
and support from Oxford Saïd Business School to scale women-led innovation.

From courtroom to code— 
she’s building Pakistan’s next pillar of justice.

Script 1:
He’s one of the fastest drivers in Pakistan—
and also runs one of its biggest oil businesses.
Meet Zain Mehmood Chaudhary—
CEO of Asia Ghee & Cooking Oil,
and two-time winner of the Cholistan Desert Rally.
Under his leadership, Asia Ghee, part of the Majeed Group of Companies,
has grown into one of Pakistan’s largest edible oil producers,
fueling kitchens across Punjab and beyond.

Outside the boardroom, Zain built a second career—

He entered the local 4×4 scene a few seasons ago, 
learning alongside senior drivers in southern Punjab. 
By 2024, he was winning A-Prepared at Cholistan— 
and he retained the title in 2025,
covering over 200 kilometers of sand and stone—
outrunning veterans like Nadir and Jaffar Magsi.
Racing runs in the family.
His father, Mahmood Majid Chaudhry, 
helped pioneer Pakistan’s 4x4 racing culture.
His sister, Zunera Mahmood, 
won the women’s category the same year he retained his title.
For Zain, business and racing follow the same rule—
you can’t control the terrain,
only how you drive through it.



Week 8 (Oct 6 - 12)
Script 4:
Pakistan’s first dating show isn’t challenging ratings— it’s challenging norms.
Lazawal Ishq, hosted by Ayesha Omar, is Pakistan’s first dating show —
filmed in Istanbul, featuring eight contestants,
and streaming on YouTube for around 100 episodes.
The choice of YouTube is deliberate.
Unbound by PEMRA rules, the series streams freely
while debate rages at home.
Early response is high views and higher criticism.
The debate isn’t just about dating— 
It's about who gets to define what’s acceptable on a Pakistani screen.

For Ayesha, the show sits at a crossroads —
between mainstream stardom and the risks of social controversy.
It could position her as a boundary-breaker in entertainment,
or as an actor navigating the cost of being first.
For participants, the trade-off is visibility versus stigma.
Dating on camera challenges social norms in a country where on-screen intimacy and extra-marital relationships draw censure;
public scrutiny won’t end when the episodes do.
For the industry, it marks a quiet shift— 
from stories about love, to love itself becoming the story.


Script 3:
He built a car forum into Pakistan’s largest auto-tech platform, trusted by millions.
That’s Suneel Sarfraz Munj,
born in Lahore, a LUMS graduate in physics and business,
who turned his obsession with cars
into a digital community that became Pakistan’s most trusted auto marketplace.
In 2003, he co-founded PakWheels —
what began as a space for enthusiasts
grew into a full ecosystem for buying, selling, and understanding cars.
Listings, inspections, reviews, even auto shows —

He didn’t hide behind the brand— he became its voice.
Through PakWheels’ YouTube channel— 
now reaching over 2.6 million subscribers and a billion views—
Suneel turned information into trust.
Every review, analysis, and market insight came from someone who understood both— 
cars, and the people buying them.
Over two decades, PakWheels moved hundreds of thousands of cars,
including over 57,000 Corollas in a single year.
He helped turn Pakistan’s car market from a trade— into an ecosystem.




Script 2:
A Pakistani film just won, for the very first time,
At the world’s biggest stage for nature storytelling—
the Jackson Wild Media Awards
The movie tells the story of the largest lake in Pakistan,
and one of the largest natural freshwater in South Asia.

And indigenous fisherfolk, 
The Mohana, often called the “mariners of Manchar,”
who have lived on boats for generations—
watching their way of life disappear
as the water that sustained them turns to dust.
The movie is called “Moklani – The Last Mohanas,”
directed by Jawad Sharif
The film doesn’t just tell a story of environmental degradation— 
it captures the intersection of climate, culture, and identity.

Since the early 2000s, the lake has suffered severe pollution and rising salinity;
waters once clear are now brackish and toxic,
causing the collapse of fish populations and displacing its people.
Selected from over 500 entries and 1,000 hours of global footage,
Moklani won the Global Voices Award in Wyoming —
proving that Pakistan’s stories can speak for the planet,
not just from it.





Script 1 (Monday):
He sailed to break the siege on Gaza —
and was arrested before he ever saw its shore.
That’s former Senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan —
a physicist turned parliamentarian from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,
who spent six years in the Senate,
and ranked among the top five senators for speaking on the floor.
He chaired the Standing Committee on Science and Technology,
led Jamaat-e-Islami’s provincial chapter,
and was known for bills defending language rights,
minority protections, and judicial accountability.
Beyond politics, he spoke out —
against excess privilege and for causes few dared to touch.
In October 2025, he became one of only two Pakistanis
to join the Global Sumud Flotilla,
a humanitarian convoy sailing to deliver aid to Gaza.
Intercepted in international waters,
he was one of nearly 500 activists from 44 countries,
aboard the Global Sumud Flotilla,
joined by Greta Thunberg and other global voices
on one of the largest civilian maritime missions in history.


Week 7 (Sep 29 - Oct 5)

Script 4:
Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are creating 1,000+ AI products — for Pakistanis.
In partnership with Saudi Arabia’s GO Telecom,
the two nations have announced the GO AI Hub Pakistan —
a five-year collaboration to develop 50,000 civic AI projects
across health, agriculture, and public governance.
Aligned with Pakistan’s National AI Policy 2025,
the hub will train engineers, fund startups,
and develop homegrown AI that can predict floods,
detect crop disease, or translate Urdu through large language models.
It’s part of Saudi Arabia’s $15.8 billion global AI initiative,
and for Pakistan — a chance to move from outsourcing technology
to owning intelligence.
This is where Pakistan enters the intelligence economy — 
not as a market, but as a maker.
Script 3:

This Karachi sound engineer just made Grammy history.
Meet Taurees Habib—
born and raised in Karachi, far from the global music capitals.

He’s been working with Hans Zimmer’s studio since at least 2016
contributing to soundtracks for Interstellar, Dunkirk, 
Blade Runner, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, 
Kung Fu Panda 3, and Man of Steel.
And in February 2025, 
his work on Zimmer’s Dune: Part Two
earned him the Grammy for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media.
Making him the first Pakistani ever to win a Grammy 
for soundtrack engineering—
and only the second Pakistani overall to hold the award.
But no headlines followed.
he waited until the golden trophy reached Karachi—
and only then did the world discover his win.
From an unnoticed victory to global recognition,
he proved that legacies aren’t always sung on stage.
Sometimes they’re engineered in silence.

Script 2: 

Two Pakistani women just premiered their films at the Toronto International Film Festival.
That’s Seemab Gul with her debut feature Ghost School,
and Sana Jafri with her short Permanent Guest.
Gul grew up in Pakistan, 
studied filmmaking at the London Film School,
and made her mark with Sandstorm—
a short that screened at Venice and Sundance.
Her first feature turns Pakistan’s “ghost schools” 
into a haunting allegory of neglect.
Jafri is no stranger to global cinema—
she produced Joyland, which won the Cannes Jury Prize,
and Yasmeen’s Element, which premiered at SXSW.
Now, with Permanent Guest, 
she directs her own story.

This year TIFF screened over 200 films from 75 countries—
And in a country without state grants or formal funding,
These two built their films on community, global networks, 
and sheer determination.

Both screenings sold out at TIFF’s 50th edition—
where global names like Guillermo del Toro, Angelina Jolie, 
and Kristen Dunst walked the same red carpets.
From directing Star Wars
to women-led stories at TIFF—
Pakistani women directors aren’t breaking in anymore.
They’re breaking through.




Script 1:

Pakistan lost to India in the Asia Cup Final Sunday night.
But it still wins in numbers—
because cricket here isn’t just a sport.
It’s history, rivalry, and business all rolled into one.

Asia Cup Final was the 16th T20 between India and Pakistan.
India now rules the short game, 13–3.
But in ODIs, it’s Pakistan who have struck more blows, 73 to 58.
In Tests, Pakistan still leads, 12 to 9
One format can tilt—but across cricket, the contest remains alive.

And the business side is even bigger.
For the 2025 Asia Cup,
The PCB’s share from broadcasting and sponsorships was pegged at PKR 3.3 to 4.4 billion.
That’s not just prize money—
that’s the engine that funds academies, salaries, and the entire system.

Even as runners-up, Pakistan takes home approximately 41.7 million rupees.
Each T20I earns the players around 419,000 rupees,
on top of central contracts and PSL deals worth up to 83 million
But criticism of the Pakistan Cricket Board —
about mismanagement and money,
has grown louder
But despite India winning most of the recent T20s, 
Pakistanis remain hooked—always waiting for the next win.



Week 6 (Sep 24 - Sep 28)


Script 4:
She is the first woman to ride solo across Pakistan on a motorcycle.
This is Zenith Irfan—
Fulfilling her late father’s unrealized dream,
she set out from Lahore at the age of 20.

She began in 2015,
and within two years had covered more than 20,000 kilometers across Pakistan—
from the plains of Punjab to the peaks of Gilgit-Baltistan.

By 2025, she has ridden 50,000+ kilometers—
the distance of going around the world more than once,
inspiring a whole generation of Pakistani women, 
many of whom now proudly share their own journeys on social media.
Global outlets including BBC, CNN, and Al Jazeera covered her story.
She also inspired documentaries and a feature film, Motorcycle Girl—
screened at Stanford as part of the Stanford Global Studies Summer Film Festival.
Now, she is planning another first-of-its-kind tour for Summer 2026
and is actively seeking sponsors to join her on this journey.
Zenith never chased podiums, profit, or position.
She chased freedom.
And in doing so,
She carried her father’s dream—not just for him, 
but for every daughter who dares to dream





Script 3:

Quaid-e-Azam’s grandson is arrested by Mumbai police
Nusli واڈیا is accused of forging papers
in a 30-year-old land case.

Born in Bombay in 1944, he is the son to Dina واڈیا,
The only child of the man who created Pakistan.
History never settled whether Dina stayed in Bombay by choice—
or by distance from her father after an interfaith marriage. 


What’s certain is that Jinnah built Pakistan, 
but his only child lived her life outside it.

Her son, now 81-year-old
Is the Chairman of the Wadia Group, 
Britannia, 
and the company he fought from being sold off in 1971 at 26 years: Bombay Dying.


That battle made him heir — 
and he scaled the conglomerate far beyond textiles.


With Britannia’s biscuits and dairy on nearly 3 million shelves, 
and profits crossing $250 million a year.
And Bombay Dyeing — 
once a textile giant, now a real estate play, 
booked $350 million profit in 2024 off Mumbai land.

Together, the Group is now worth close to $16 billion.
History drew a border—
business grew on one side of it.
What Nusli might’ve built in Pakistan, we’ll never know.
But the grandson of Pakistan’s founder became one of India’s most consequential industrial heirs—
and he’s back in the headlines.





Script 2:
Remember when a video claimed there was a lizard in a Layers cake?
For most bakeries, that would’ve been the end.

But Layers didn’t just survive this—
they scaled.
What started as a single store in Lahore in 2020,
runs a 32 outlet giant across Pakistan in 2025—
They are present in major cities across
Lahore, Islamabad, Karachi, and more
Their edge? No franchising.
Every outlet company-owned—
so quality never slips.
From Lotus cheesecakes to molten brownies,
they turned “designer desserts” into everyday treats.
While high-end cake shops charge around PKR 1300+ per pound,
Layers 2.5 pound cakes range from 1900 to 3400+ PKR
With competitive prices, Instagram-curated desserts, and nationwide consistency—
Layers has become the go-to for most occasions 
And are dominating the “affordable premium” dessert chain category in the country,

and that's not all,
They expanded to Long Island, New York,
and Manhattan as well.
From one shop in Lahore to global streets in just five years—
Layers proved a brand isn’t ruined by scandal,
when it’s built on trust.

Week 5 (Sep 8 - Sep 15)



Script 3:
She is directing the new Star Wars movie—
and she is from Pakistan.
That’s Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, <شرمین عبید چنائے)
two-time Oscar and seven-time Emmy winner,
now the first Pakistani filmmaker ever tapped to direct a Star Wars film.
Armed with degrees from Smith and Stanford, 

Her Oscar-winning films didn’t just win awards—
Saving Face pushed Pakistan to toughen its acid attack laws, 
and A Girl in the River led the Prime Minister to close legal loopholes on honor killings.
Born in Karachi, she began as a teenage investigative reporter before turning to film.
Her directorial debut in 2003, <(add visual of “Terror’s Children” here)>
made for The New York Times,
Won the Overseas Press Club and 
the South Asian Journalist Association Award. 
In 2012, Saving Face made Sharmeen Pakistan’s first Oscar winner 
An award she won again in 2016 for A Girl in the River.

Sharmeen is now taking the director’s chair for Star Wars
with a script by Steven Knight, 
and Rey returning 15 years later to rebuild the Jedi Order.

This isn’t just a milestone for Hollywood—
it’s Sharmeen’s, and Pakistan’s, place in cinematic history.
.




Script 2:


Yamaha is closing in Pakistan.
An end to a journey that first began in 1975,
and was relaunched with big promises in 2015.


From their Karachi plant, Yamaha launched stylish 125cc models 
priced between PKR 424,000 and 485,000, 
aimed at young riders seeking performance.
Honda’s CG-125, by contrast, 
retailed at just PKR 234,900, 
while Suzuki’s popular commuter models started around PKR 370,000–400,000—


Spare parts and warranties will continue,
but the assembly lines are gone.


For riders, the roads go on.
For Yamaha, it’s the end of an era.




Script 1:
He broke a Guinness World Record for Pakistani soldiers.
Meet Faisal Shafi—strength coach and marathoner from Karachi.
He’s already completed 12 full marathons,
including five Abbott World Marathon Majors.
In 2025, he lined up in Sydney—
the newest Abbott Major.
Not in racing gear, but in a military uniform.
3 hours, 40 minutes, 13 seconds later—
he crossed the finish line,
setting a Guinness World Record in his category,
and earning his seventh Abbott star.
That day, 36 Pakistanis ran in Sydney—
Ali Zaidi led the pack as the fastest Pakistani, 
finishing in 3:05:33. 
Right behind him,
Bilal Ehsan crossed in 3:15:03—
marking a strong showing for Pakistan that day.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
but still finish together on the world stage.






August Week 5 (Sep 2 - Sep 7)


Script 5:

They beat 2,000 competitors worldwide 
and won $1.5 million on /
This is Myco— founded by Umair Masoom—
a Web3 streaming platform with a “watch-and-earn” model 
where viewers earn rewards for watching 
and creators get paid directly through blockchain.

The founders’ goal is to move video onto blockchain, 
so creators can truly own their content 
and no platform can take it down or control it.

Myco secured the largest deal of the season:
They won a deal: — 
$500,000 in investment and 
a $1 million software contract with Tim Draper.

The numbers back it up.
In just 18 months, Myco grew to 20 million users, 
delivers 100M+ video impressions every month, 
and now operates in 100+ countries.

Myco’s win proves Pakistan’s startups are shaping the future of streaming—
one where creators and audiences, 
not platforms, are in control.

Script 4:
She saved 20,000+ babies and is known as the Mother of Pakistan.
This is Bilquis Edhi, wife of Abdul Sattar Edhi.


Born in Karachi in 1947, 
she trained as a nurse and married Abdul Sattar in 1966— 
accepting a one-room clinic as her home.
Bilquis initiated the idea of placing baby cradles outside Edhi centers.
These cradles carried the sign: “Do not kill your child. Leave them here.”
This initiative saved over 20,000 babies
For her services, 
she received the Hilal-i-Imtiaz, 
the Lenin Peace Prize, 
the Paul Harris Fellowship, 
and was listed in BBC’s 100 Women of Impact in 2015.

Blunt in her words and strict in discipline, 
Bilquis was also deeply maternal — 

personally supervising children, adoptions, and women in crisis.

Despite global recognition, she rarely gave interviews. 
Her work spoke louder than any spotlight could. 
She passed away at 74, in April 2022.

She never ran for office.
She never built a company.
Yet she raised a nation.
She taught us that responsibility doesn’t need power or position—
it only needs commitment.



Script 3:
In پاکستان, there’s only one school where children run the system.
There are no grades, no uniforms,and no principal’s office—
that school is called Edopia in Islamabad 
Behind it is Javeyria Sethi, a Harvard alumni and an educator
who believes that childhood was being lost in rigid classrooms.
So in her school, 200 students are building their own system of learning.
Her philosophy is simple:
learning should grow from curiosity,
conflict should teach dialogue,
and failure should be progress.
In Edopia, the day runs in three parts:
academics, community, and choice time—
from math and assemblies to coding and finance.
Teachers guide instead of lecture.
And children vote on rules, projects, and community issues.

While some parents say the fees feel very high.
Others argue it matches Islamabad’s top private schools.
Commonly, schools measure success in grades and exams.
Edopia reminds us that the real test
is the citizens we raise, not the marks they score.




Script 2:

A Pakistani architect won this award
For the first time in 27 years.


His name is Saifullah Siddiqui,
founder of DB Studios.
and he won the Aga Khan Award for Architecture.
Which is architecture’s most prestigious prize.
From 40+ countries, architects compete every 3 years.
And only seven projects win a share of $1 million—
making it one of the world’s toughest honors.
Saifullah built his practice on a simple belief—
that architecture isn’t just form,
it’s function tied to culture.
Spaces, he says, must grow from the ground they stand on,
rooted in local craft, geography, and community.
That philosophy gave birth to the award winning “Vision Pakistan”
A vocational training centre in Islamabad,
its vibrant concrete jaali façade reimagines tradition with modernist clarity.
And inside—classrooms that teach tailoring, literacy, and life skills
to youth who need a second chance.
For Saifullah, it’s recognition.
For Pakistanis, it’s proof—
that our stories, our skills, 
and our spaces belong on the global stage.



Script 1:




She doesn’t measure success in millions—
she measures it in meals delivered, surgeries funded, and lives uplifted.




That’s Kanwal Cheema, the woman building My Impact Meter—
The country’s first digital charity platform that shows exactly where your donation goes, backed by HEC’s Innovator Seed Fund.


Before impact, she mastered tech.
Kanwal studied computer science—
and built a global career leading accounts at Cisco
and heading marketing at Graphiant, a Silicon Valley startup.


But in 2020, she came back to Lahore with one question:
what if success wasn’t measured in profit— but in the impact you could prove?


So she built The app that connects donors and NGOs directly with verified beneficiaries—

With My Impact Meter, you don’t send cash—
you buy a digital voucher for food, healthcare, or education.
Add a beneficiary by phone and CNIC, or support a verified NGO case,
and the beneficiary redeems it at approved providers—while you see the proof inside your app.




It’s not just charity.
It’s success redefined—where the outcome isn’t money made,
but lives changed, and impact you can measure.

Script 4:
Pakistan’s richest ∫´guy spends over $1 million every year…
not on yachts or jets—
but in free schools and hospitals.


Meet Syed Babar Ali, at 99, he still works for a salary today.


After studying at Aitchison, Wharton, and Michigan,
He didn’t just inherit his father’s paper mill,
he scaled Packages Limited from a small venture in 1956
into Pakistan’s largest packaging empire.
By the ’70s, Packages was clocking 15% annual growth
with sales hitting PKR 150 million.
It spun off brands that changed daily life—
from Milkpak (now Nestlé Pakistan)
to Tetra Pak, and beyond.
Today, Packages is worth PKR 61.8 billion,,
while Babar’s personal net worth is pegged at $300–500 million.
He no longer runs Packages—his son Hyder Ali is CEO—
but he remains the strategist behind the empire.

His vision went beyond business.
In 1985, he founded LUMS university, and also
6 free schools in Lahore 
for 500+ children,
providing education, meals, and healthcare—
a chance to step out of poverty.
At 99, he proves real legacy isn’t in riches—but in impact.


Script 3:
On August 14, Pakistan launched the world’s first AI-powered English news channel.
Proof that tech’s next chapter isn’t just written in the West.
Led by Dr. Kaiser Rafiq and Discover Pakistan TV,
Pakistan Today doesn’t just feature one AI anchor—
It's an entire newsroom run by artificial intelligence.
Every anchor, every reporter, every bulletin—
generated by AI avatars capable of 1,500 facial movements,
lifelike voice, and real-time scriptwriting powered by natural language models.
From a London studio, it already streams globally.
Soon, with AI translation, it will deliver news in 40+ languages.
Others experimented—China in 2018, India in 2023—
but no one built a full channel until now.
The goal isn’t to replace journalists—
it’s to let AI handle speed and scale,
so humans can focus on the depth and truth behind the headlines.
With Pakistan Today,
Pakistan didn’t just innovate in media—
it redefined it.
Because sometimes the headlines come from where the world least expects them.


Script 2:

She dropped out of high school.
and was rejected by over 438 investors.
Yet in 2025, Maha Shahzad’s BusCaro is projected to earn $6.3 million—
moving more than 20,000 people every day.
Raised by a single father between Pakistan, Europe and the U.S.,
she saw how commuting wasn’t just costly—
it was unsafe.


She first worked at Foodpanda, 
Then honed her skills at Careem,
and later led Swvl in Pakistan—
two global mobility giants that eventually shut down here.

Their collapse exposed how little families could depend on reliable transport 
So when Maha built her company, 
she began with the places that needed it most:
schools, universities, and factories—
She started with one bus.
Today: 900 vehicles, 10 million bookings,
and 80+ institutions rely on BusCaro—
with more than 6,600 women riding safer every day.
In a country where safety kept women home,
she mapped the fear—
and turned it into a route.




Script 1:
From Parizaad’s spotlight…





to financial literacy’s frontline.





Mashal Khan left her acting career at its peak—
to teach Pakistan how to read a balance sheet.

She was Kinza in Suno Chanda—

a role that made her a household name.

In just five years, she appeared in Khaas, 


Thora Sa Haq, 


and Parizaad.

The kind of résumé most actresses spend decades chasing.

And then—she walked away.


Turning down auditions, fame, and the comfort of celebrity.
Asked why, she said: “I wanted more from life.” 
Not applause… but impact.


In January 2025, she launched مشعلverse.
Just 8 months later — by August 2025 —
342,000 followers are learning 
crypto, 
stocks, 
and investments from her explainers.


Her content now reaches hundreds of thousands online,
and she’s even appeared on 365 News with The Inside Scoop,
bringing economic updates to a wider audience.


From scripts to spreadsheets,
from applause to awareness—
Mashal Khan showed that her choice wasn’t between acting or finance
It was between limits and new possibilities

QAS Script 1:
Robots are the future of physiotherapy.
And they’re being built in Pakistan.
Meet Hadi Muhammad, founder of Strydex Robotics.
A startup designing walking-assist exoskeletons—
robots that help stroke survivors
and paraplegic patients stand, move, and even walk again.
In August 2025, Strydex went head-to-head
with 2,800 startups worldwide at the SEE Pakistan World Startup Championship.
And walked away as winners in the Ideation Category.
This isn’t just a trophy — it’s a shot at transformation.
In Pakistan, that means 4 million stroke survivors.
Worldwide, tens of millions more live with paralysis.
If Strydex succeeds — those are the lives their exoskeletons could change.
But startup history is clear: recognition is step one, scale is the battle.
This win puts Strydex on the map.
Now the real milestone will be seeing patients walk again with their exoskeletons.
Strydex is part of a wave of ideas proving:
Pakistan’s innovation isn’t on the sidelines anymore.
From AI policies to clean-energy breakthroughs —
2025 is showing the world Pakistan is ready to build the future.
And with startups like Strydex —
we’ll walk into that future with our heads held high.
QAS Script 2:

Pakistan once banned crypto.
Now the government owns it.
2025: the state sets up its first Bitcoin reserve.

Dedicating 2,000 megawatts to crypto mining and AI data hubs.
And even testing a digital rupee —
making payments faster than ever.
This shift means legitimacy, safer access, and room to grow,
For 20 million Pakistanis already holding crypto.

And the man steering this move is Bilal Bin Saqib.
Graduate of the London School of Economics.
Awarded an MBE in 2023, 
and Co-founder of Tayaba that got him in Forbes 30 under 30 
for ease of water access for rural women in Pakistan .
He is a social entrepreneur—
turning ideas into impact.

But critics say running a national crypto framework
needs deeper financial and regulatory expertise.
And mining isn’t green—emitting up to 65 million tonnes of CO₂ a year,
adding risk to Pakistan’s climate struggles.

On paper, it’s Pakistan’s boldest tech gamble yet—
but there is no clarity yet on regulation, investor protection,
mining timelines, or when the digital rupee will actually launch.
Still—this pivot puts Pakistan in the global crypto race.
If done right, this could turn risk into opportunity, and policy into progress.
QAS Script 3:


LUMS is no longer just for the privileged. 
In 2025, Aleena Nadeem leveled the field,
With EduFi

An MIT graduate and Forbes 30 under 30,
She saw a barrier: bright students with the grades, 
the drive, and the ambition—
stopped at the gate by a fee they couldn’t pay.

So in 2021, she launched EduFi— 
Pakistan’s first Study Now, Pay Later platform
making student loans simple, fast, and within reach.

Aleena used tech not just to digitize lending, 
but to close one of Pakistan’s toughest education gaps.

By mid-2022—
EduFi reached 15 universities, supporting 200,000 students. 
In its first six months, it deployed over $500,000 in low-interest loans 
with under 0.01% default rates. 

Backed by a record-setting $6.1 million pre-seed round,
Today, EduFi added LUMS to its partner list with 17 others, 
and scooped $250k at LEAP in Riyadh, beating over 2,000 startups.

With EduFi, Aleena didn’t just digitize loans—she reimagined access to education.
Her vision made it simple, scalable, and unstoppable—
so brilliance, not background, decides who gets through the door.


QAS Script 4:


This store closed two weeks after opening—
because they were sold out.
These were Khaadi’s earliest days.


Their logo? Knuckles of a craftsman’s hand.
Not abstract design— 
but a reminder that real hands built this brand.


Launched in 1998 by Shamoon Sultan 
with one small store in Karachi.
By 2015, the brand had scaled to 46 stores in 17 Pakistani cities, 
and 17 more in the UK and Gulf.
In 2019, they launched Kanteen cafés inside its flagship— the first fashion retailer in Pakistan to fuse dining and retail.
During the pandemic,
while lockdowns froze fashion—
Shamoon turned its largest stores into fulfillment hubs for online delivery,
One of the few in the country at that time—
By 2022, it was running around 60 stores in 30 cities, 
with revenues jumping from PKR 18 billion to 22.7 billion.
Profits flipped from a PKR 130 million loss in 2021
to 855 million profit in 2022.
And in 2024, they entered the U.S.— 
opening a flagship in Tysons, Virginia, and expanding to Houston.
This story isn’t done.
It’s building more than stores— 
it’s building a new identity for Pakistan abroad.
Showing the world that Pakistan can scale fashion without losing its soul.


QAS Script 5:
Hook:
 
A 100-foot kurta put Pakistan in Guinness World Records…
Designed by Deepak Perwani, 
stitched in Karachi by fifty craftsmen,
over 30 days, with 800 kilos of fabric.

But who is Deepak Perwani?
Born in 1973 in Mirpurkhas, Sindh—
to a modest Hindu family in a small town—
he launched his label in 1996,
Hailed as Pakistan’s first couture house for menswear and bridal.

He earned a reputation as fashion’s rockstar —
bold, magnetic, and unafraid to challenge how men dressed
His designs earned him a standing ovation at Milan Fashion Week

Recognition that gave Pakistan’s designers leverage— 
in sponsorships, councils, and international showcases.

From a small-town boy to fashion’s front row —
his dream was to make Pakistan impossible to ignore.
He worked with Mercedes-Benz, Hugo Boss, Benson & Hedges.
And helped found the Fashion Pakistan Council.

With a net worth crossing PKR 71 crore, 
he stands as Pakistan’s richest Hindu— 
proof that fashion here isn’t just art, it can build generational wealth
From a record-breaking kurta to global acclaim —
Deepak Perwani stitched not just clothes,
but Pakistan’s pride into fashion itself.
